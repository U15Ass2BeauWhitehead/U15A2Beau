Through our work, we bring Slovak-speaking families together, helping them build friendships, strengthen their cultural ties, and feel at home even while living in the UK.<br><br>Education is at the heart of what we do, but our purpose extends even further.

Our official launch on 15th September was a proud moment, celebrated in collaboration with the Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela and the Association of Slovak Schools and Community Centres in the UK.<br><br>Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting Slovak-speaking families, students, and individuals who wish to learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture together.</p>
