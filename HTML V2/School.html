			<p>At <b>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester</b>, we are proud to be <b>qualified educators</b> with extensive experience across various educational settings.

<h2>Integrated Language & Cultural Learning</h2>
<p>We believe that <b>language and culture are inseparable</b>, which is why our <b>curriculum aligns with our cultural events and workshops.</b> This approach ensures that students not only learn Slovak in the classroom but also experience it in <b>real-life situations</b>. While these events are part of our curriculum, they are also open to <b>members who wish to attend workshops only</b>, providing flexibility to suit individual interests.</p>
<br>

<h2>Our Teaching Methods</h2>
<p>Our teaching is always <b>student-centred</b>, focusing on <b>active participation, communication, and real-world application.</b> We incorporate several well-established language teaching methodologies, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)</b> – Prioritising <b>fluency over accuracy</b>, especially in the early stages of learning, to build confidence in speaking.</li>
	<li><b>Task-Based Learning (TBL)</b> – Using real-life tasks to develop <b>vocabulary and functional language skills.</b></li>
	<li><b>Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL)</b> – Combining language learning with <b>cultural education,</b> allowing students to learn Slovak through meaningful cultural topics.</li>
	<li><b>Cooperative Language Learning (CLL)</b> – Encouraging students to <b>work in pairs or small groups,</b> maximising interaction, communication, and collaborative problem-solving.</li>
</ul>

<p>In our classrooms, students learn by <b>engaging in practical activities, group discussions, and interactive projects,</b> while teachers act as <b>facilitators</b>, guiding students through the learning process in an <b>immersive and supportive environment.</b></p>

<p>Our approach ensures that students <b>develop confidence in using Slovak in everyday life,</b> while also <b>connecting with their cultural roots</b> in an enjoyable and meaningful way.</p>
